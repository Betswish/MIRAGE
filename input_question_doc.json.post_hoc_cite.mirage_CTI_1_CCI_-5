        "output": "[4][3] According to a report by Bloomberg, citing a source with knowledge of the matter, Snapchat is currently seeking to raise $500 million at a valuation of $16 billion to $19 billion. [1][4] This would make the Los Angeles-based mobile messaging app the third most highly valued tech start-up backed by venture capitalists, behind Chinese handset maker Xiaomi at $45 billion and Uber at approximately $40 billion, based on data from CB Insights. [5][4] However, as highlighted by a MoneyTips article, even tech giants like Uber, with a valuation of over $62 billion, will be under pressure to demonstrate profitability in the coming years. [5] In fact, cracks are already appearing in the pre-IPO valuations of companies such as Dropbox, Snapchat, and Square, which have experienced nearly a quarter and one-third drop in their respective valuations. [5] Larger investors and venture capitalists are sending a clear message to these unicorns: Outline a solid path to profits and start delivering them soon, or expect your valuation to be significantly reduced.  This highlights the need for these tech start-ups to focus on achieving profitability rather than just securing high valuations through funding rounds."

        "output": " When data is compressed or zipped, the actual process involves reducing the size of the data without compromising its integrity.  This is achieved through algorithms that remove redundant information and replace it with a smaller representation of the original data. [1][5] Compression is commonly used in file systems, disks, multimedia formats like JPEG and MP3, and communication technologies like fax and Skype to save space and reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted. [2] Data compression also provides additional data protection through encryption, as seen in programs like AllSync. [3][5] Strong security has been added to the ZIP format, making it a popular choice for data centers and IT shops, as it provides interoperability between platforms and significant savings in DASD and bandwidth. [1][4] However, it's essential to note that repeatedly compressing and decompressing a file may lead to increased file size due to overhead. [3] In contrast, data deduplication differs from compression as it eliminates redundant data blocks in a storage system to save space. [5] In audio recordings, compression refers to level compression and/or limiting, which reduces the dynamic range of a signal to achieve a desired sound level or prevent distortion during recording or mixing."
