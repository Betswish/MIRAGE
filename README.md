> **Abstract:** Ensuring the verifiability of model answers is a fundamental challenge for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in the question answering (QA) domain. Recently, self-citation prompting was proposed to make large language models (LLMs) generate citations to supporting documents along with their answers. However, self-citing LLMs often struggle to match the required format, refer to non-existent sources, and fail to faithfully reflect LLMs' context usage throughout the generation. In this work, we present MIRAGE --Model Internals-based RAG Explanations -- a plug-and-play approach using model internals for faithful answer attribution in RAG applications. MIRAGE detects context-sensitive answer tokens and pairs them with retrieved documents contributing to their prediction via saliency methods. We evaluate our proposed approach on a multilingual extractive QA dataset, finding high agreement with human answer attribution. On open-ended QA, MIRAGE achieves citation quality and efficiency comparable to self-citation while also allowing for a finer-grained control of attribution parameters. Our qualitative evaluation highlights the faithfulness of MIRAGE's attributions and underscores the promising application of model internals for RAG answer attribution.

## Environment: 
Python: 3.9.19

Packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Quick Start
For a quick start, you only need to put your RAG input in the `data_input/` folder and run the following **one** command to get the LLM outputs with answer attribution:

```
python mirage.py --f data_input/example.json --config configs/llama2_standard_prompt.yaml
```

The LLM outputs will be saved in the folder `data_input_with_ans/`, and the model internals obtained by MIRAGE will be saved in `internal_res/`.
The parameters are listed below:
- `f`: Path to the input file.
- `config`: Path to the configuration file, containing the generation parameters and prompts.
- `CTI`: How many standard deviations over average for CTI threshold, default `1`.
- `CCI`: Parameter for CCI filtering. Using Top k strategy if k > 0; otherwise Top (-k)% if k < 0.

## Extra Parameters
If you already have LLM generations in the data file, put it in the `data_input_with_ans` and specify the parameter `f_with_ans`.

```bash
mkdir data_input_with_ans
python mirage.py --f data_input_with_ans --config configs/llama2_standard_prompt.yaml --f_with_ans
```
