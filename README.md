> **Abstract:** Ensuring the verifiability of model answers is a fundamental challenge for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in the question answering (QA) domain. Recently, self-citation prompting was proposed to make large language models (LLMs) generate citations to supporting documents along with their answers. However, self-citing LLMs often struggle to match the required format, refer to non-existent sources, and fail to faithfully reflect LLMs' context usage throughout the generation. In this work, we present MIRAGE --Model Internals-based RAG Explanations -- a plug-and-play approach using model internals for faithful answer attribution in RAG applications. MIRAGE detects context-sensitive answer tokens and pairs them with retrieved documents contributing to their prediction via saliency methods. We evaluate our proposed approach on a multilingual extractive QA dataset, finding high agreement with human answer attribution. On open-ended QA, MIRAGE achieves citation quality and efficiency comparable to self-citation while also allowing for a finer-grained control of attribution parameters. Our qualitative evaluation highlights the faithfulness of MIRAGE's attributions and underscores the promising application of model internals for RAG answer attribution.

> [!NOTE] 
> This repository provides an easy-to-use MIRAGE framework for analyzing the groundedness of RAG generation to the retrieved documents. To reproduce the paper results, please take a look at [this repo](https://github.com/Betswish/MIRAGE-reproduce).

## Environment: 
Python: `3.9.19`

Packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Transformers: `4.41.0.dev0`

Inseq: `0.6.0.dev0`

## Quick Start
For a quick start, you only need to put your RAG Data file in `data_input/` folder and run the following **one** command to get the LLM outputs with answer attribution (e.g. LLaMA2 with standard prompt):

```
python mirage.py --f data_input/EXAMPLE.json --config configs/llama2_standard_prompt.yaml
```

The data file should be in JSON format. For example, suppose you have two questions, each provided with two retrieved docs:
```json
[
  {
    "question": "YOUR QUESTION",
    "docs": [
      {
        "title": "TITLE OF RETRIEVED DOC",
        "text": "TEXT OF RETRIEVED DOC"
      },
      {
        "title": "TITLE OF RETRIEVED DOC",
        "text": "TEXT OF RETRIEVED DOC"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "question": "YOUR QUESTION",
    "docs": [
      {
        "title": "TITLE OF RETRIEVED DOC",
        "text": "TEXT OF RETRIEVED DOC"
      },
      {
        "title": "TITLE OF RETRIEVED DOC",
        "text": "TEXT OF RETRIEVED DOC"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
The data with LLM's raw outputs will be saved in the folder `data_input_with_ans/`, and the attributed answers will be saved in `res_AA/` folder. 

You may also check `internal_res/` for the model internals obtained by MIRAGE. The internal of each instance is saved as an individual JSON file, which can be used for advanced functions below.

## Full functions
The all parameters for `mirage.py` are listed below:
- `f`: Path to the input file.
- `config`: Path to the configuration file, containing the generation parameters and prompts.
- `CTI`: CTI threshold. This means how many standard deviations over average, default `1`.
- `CCI`: CCI threshold. Using Top k strategy if k > 0; otherwise Top (-k)% if k < 0, default `-5`.

#### Advanced Feature 1
If you already have LLM generations (e.g. LLaMA2 with standard prompt) in the data file, like:
```json
[
  {
    "question": "YOUR QUESTION",
    "docs": [
      {
        "title": "TITLE OF RETRIEVED DOC",
        "text": "TEXT OF RETRIEVED DOC"
      },
      {
        "title": "TITLE OF RETRIEVED DOC",
        "text": "TEXT OF RETRIEVED DOC"
      }
    ],
    "output": "LLM GENERATED ANSWER"
  },
  {
    "question": "YOUR QUESTION",
    "docs": [
      {
        "title": "TITLE OF RETRIEVED DOC",
        "text": "TEXT OF RETRIEVED DOC"
      },
      {
        "title": "TITLE OF RETRIEVED DOC",
        "text": "TEXT OF RETRIEVED DOC"
      }
    ],
    "output": "LLM GENERATED ANSWER"
  }
]
```
put it in the `data_input_with_ans/` folder and specify `--f_with_ans` to get the answer attribution for the LLM outputs you already have:

```bash
mkdir data_input_with_ans
python mirage.py --f data_input_with_ans/EXAMPLE_WITH_ANS.json --config configs/llama2_standard_prompt.yaml --f_with_ans
```

#### Advanced Feature 2
After a first run, you should have got: 
- a JSON file containing LLM outputs in `data_input_with_ans/`, whether generated by our code or uploaded by yourself, e.g. `EXAMPLE_WITH_ANS.json`.
- a JSON file in the `res_AA/` folder with MIRAGE-attributed answers, named after `res_AA/EXAMPLE.json.mirage_CTI_X_CCI_X`.
- multiple JSON files saving model internals obtained by MIRAGE at `internal_res/`, like `internal_res/EXAMPLE_WITH_ANS-0.json`, `internal_res/EXAMPLE_WITH_ANS-1.json`, etc.

If you plan to try different CTI and CCI thresholds, set the data file **with** LLM outputs as `--f` and specify `--f_with_ans` and `--only_cite`.
It allows you to try different combinations of CTI and CCI thresholds with the existing model internal files, instead of analyzing model internals from scratch, saving you treasure time. :)
```bash
python mirage.py --f data_input_with_ans/EXAMPLE_WITH_ANS.json --config configs/llama2_standard_prompt.yaml --f_with_ans --only_cite --CTI X --CCI X
```
